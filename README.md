# **âš½ SoccerNet Highlight Generator**

## **ðŸ“– Overview**
This project automates the creation of soccer match highlights by:
- Downloading match videos.
- Identifying key moments.
- Compiling highlight reels.

It uses **ResNet-50** for feature extraction and a custom **GRU model with an attention mechanism** for event classification. For a live demonstration, the model can be deployed using tools like Gradio for interactive exploration.

---

## **âœ¨ Features**

### **1. Data Preparation**
- **Dataset Source**: Leverages the SoccerNet dataset, which includes match videos and JSON files with detailed annotations.
- **Clip Extraction**: Extracts 10-second clips around key moments. For example:
  - If a goal occurs at 20 minutes, a clip from 19:55 to 20:05 is saved in the **goals** folder.
- **Organized Training Data**: Creates labeled folders (e.g., `goals`, `fouls`, `corners`) for each action type.

---

### **2. Model Training**
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts 10-second clips into tensors using a pre-trained **ResNet-50** model.
- **Training Process**: 
  - Pairs feature tensors with labels (folder names).
  - Feeds them into a custom **GRU model with attention** for classification.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Optimizes the GRU model for precise event detection.
- **Output**: Produces a trained model that can identify soccer actions from video clips.

---

### **3. Action Detection**
- **Video Segmentation**: Divides full match videos into 10-second clips.
- **Action Classification**: Passes each clip through the trained model to classify actions (e.g., goal, foul, kickoff).
- **Action Ranking**: Assigns importance scores to actions based on predefined rankings.

---

### **4. Highlight Generation**
- **Key Moment Selection**: Identifies the most critical moments using rankings.
- **Highlight Compilation**: Stitches the clips into a smooth highlight reel.
- **Automated Workflow**: Generates highlight videos from full match footage, ready for sharing.

---

### **5. User Interaction**
- **Input**: Users upload a full soccer match video.
- **Output**: A polished highlight reel featuring the most exciting moments.
